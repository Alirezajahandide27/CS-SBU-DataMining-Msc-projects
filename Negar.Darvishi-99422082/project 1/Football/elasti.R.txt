```
install.packages("elastic")
library('elastic')
connect(es_port = 9200)
count(index='spainsoccer')
Search(index = "spainsoccer", size=10, id= 10 )$hits$hits  #to get 10 id data for type= liga_data 
#spainsoccer is also the database name, which is used here for automatic indexing within elastic database.
```

we choose 3920, as this the maximum size of our data right now, it could be increased or decreased as per requirements.
we can change that and specify our custom index by using `docs_bulk(spainsoccer, index = "elasticsoccer")`
```
res <- Search(index = "spainsoccer", size=3920, asdf = T) #dataframe
resdf <- res$hits$hits$'_source'
```
